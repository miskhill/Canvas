# Canvas
HTML Canvas testing with JS functions
I used a 2D canvas setting and utilised the X & Y axis to draw with
Use of Mousemove mousedown mouseup mouseout
ctx use (similar to CSS imo) stroke style and hsl use
ES6 array function use (double up the variables)
mother-effing hsl website used for the lightness and alpha colours
use incremental colours let hue = 0 and 
use a loop to change the start position ++ and reset to change ctx line widths
use globalCompositeOperation > blend the colours
